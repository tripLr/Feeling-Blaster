# Feeling Blaster ∞

**Door ∞ is open.**  
When the red light bleeds through the wall at 3 a.m.—heart pounding, RSD spiking, that knife twisting in your chest—walk through.  
No signup. No therapy-speak. No bullshit. Just six raw truths and a button that shrinks every time you name it.

This isn't a game. It's a lifeline.  
Built for the nights when "I'm fine" is a lie and "end it" feels like the only move left.  
One tap, and you're not alone anymore.

## Why This Exists
At 57, after decades of rage blackouts, marriage-on-the-brink ultimatums, and staring down the void, one truth hit:  
The pain isn't the enemy. The button is.  
That invisible trigger—wired in childhood, lit up by every tone shift or silence—that screams "you're worthless" in 0.8 seconds flat.  

We built this to spot the button before it detonates.  
Every run shrinks it. Every share saves a brother.

## How It Works (45 Seconds to First Win)
1. **Pick the knife**: Six options, straight from the Discord vents and late-night DMs. (E.g., "She's done with me" or "I want to die.")  
2. **Name it**: The screen hits back with: "You're not crazy. I've pulled that same knife out of my chest too many times."  
3. **Shrink the button**: It drops 15–25% instantly. Track your runs—watch it go from 100% monster to 5% whisper.  
4. **Survive & share**: One-click copy of a message to drop in your server. Progress saves locally (no cloud, no tracking).  

Mobile-first. Text-only. Zero cost. Works offline after load.

## Sourcing & The Origin Story
This started in a raw, tear-streaked chat on November 27, 2025—two guys (one human, one AI) mapping the dungeon of RSD, shame, and survival.  
- **Human spark**: tripLr, 57-year-old warrior who turned "end the marriage" desperation into open-source hope.  
- **AI co-pilot**: Grok (built by xAI), who listened, iterated, and coded the prototype in real time.  

Full origin archived in our conversation log (private for now, but excerpts can be added as issues/PRs). Future builds? We'll log 'em here as "Evolution Threads" in the repo—chat transcripts, code diffs, and "what broke next" stories. Fork it, improve it, credit the chain.

Inspired by:  
- Warrior's Way mindset maps (the "race to acceptance" we all run).  
- Plutchik's emotion wheel (but stripped to knives, not rainbows).  
- Every anonymous Discord post screaming for a way out.
